If you choose to have FastBot integrate with HealthKit then the application will have access only to the health data types you opt-in to access.

The data read from HealthKit is used solely within the app. It is not collected or disclosed outside of your local installation of the the app. Only those data types relevant to the app are accessed. The data read is used to analyze and verify the body fat and weight data saved to the HealthKit store. In no case is your personal data ever transfered to a 3rd party. It is only ever kept within the application container of FastBot or transfered to your personal HealthKit data store as per your permission choices.
